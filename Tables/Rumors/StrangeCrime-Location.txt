at home
in the street in broad daylight
in a dark alley
in a tavern
at a brothel
on the outskirts of town
in the park
in someone's garden
in a temple
on the town square
out in the woods
down by the lake
in the swamp
in the nearby ruin
in a nearby cave
by the sewer exit
in a guard tower
in an abandoned house
in an abandoned warehouse
in an old mansion
in the stable of an old estate
in the greenhouse of an old mansion
in a crypt
in a library
at the victims own place of work
in the victims own bedroom
in a hidden room in the victims own house
in the common room of a local guild
on a boat on the lake
on a quiet mountain road
on a track in the woods
out by the waterfall
in the cathedral
in the old church
in the catacombs
at an undisclosed location
