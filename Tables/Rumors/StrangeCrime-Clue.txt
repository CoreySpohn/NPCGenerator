a local cult with rather extreme beliefs
a lock of strange fur
a rumoured jealous lover
a hot tempered spouse
the local child, the one with the strangest eyes
markings of something having entered from beyond
remnants of the darkest magic
revenge
lust
greed
a murky acquaintance from the victim's past
that old tablet covered in obscure symbols
the terrible story no one wants to remember
an old friend of the PCs
a beautiful young woman, who only came to town recently
another horrid crime committed not long ago
the escaped criminal, rumored to be in hiding nearby
markings of a wild animal
that deep rumble, that you might hear coming from below the surface of the paved roads from time to time.
the nightly activities of one of the PCs, but it's all so hazy...
