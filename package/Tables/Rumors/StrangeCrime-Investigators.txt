the city guard
royal guard
a fearsome crew with obvious scars of battle
a strange and quiet group, not known by any of the locals
men of the church
an old man in a robe and his dog
a middleaged woman in a simple uniform with her young male assistant
a young man, who won't disclose his relationship to the victim assisted by his mute brother
