# NPCGenerator
CREDITS:
	This whole thing just me streamlining the use of things that are already available.
	Thanks to:
		Anyone and everyone involved with these for the tables, ideas, and DnD:
			r/BehindTheTables, r/DnDBehindTheScreen, Dragon Magazine, FantasyNameGenerators.com, Wizards of the Coast, TSR, Dragon magazine, and tons of other websites/people I've taken tables from and forgotten where they came from.
		Stackexchange.com because I've never made anything like this before

FEATURES:
	Create an NPC with a name, race, gender, age, personality, current mood, reaction, motivation, profession, physical description, and voice with one click
	Race/gender specific name generation
		Races included: Humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, gnomes, half-orcs, half-elves, dragonborn, and tieflings
		Gender matters for Humans, dwarves, half-elves, and tieflings
	Ages appropriate for the race based on the PHB (children are generally not included)
	If you middle click on the gender button it toggles it
	Right clicking on the buttons gives a list of toggles for more customizablity
		Toggles are saved when you close the program		
	Click the bottom button to export your generated NPC to an excel sheet. It will save them after the window is closed and the table can be copy pasted into OneNote already formatted.
	Automatically moves old excel sheets to the folder Old NPCs and renames them based on todays date
	If you like most of the NPC but not all of it you can reroll the parts that you don't like by clicking the button on the left before exporting with the button at the bottom
	Works really well with a tablet

TO RUN:
	Well it should just run if you double click on NPCGenerator.exe

CUSTOMIZATION:
	Go to the Tables folder and edit the text files
	If you want to add or remove things to the tables the program will still run fine (hopefully)
		Well, as long as you don't change the text file's name or location
		Make sure that the last line in the text file still has an enter after it

KNOWN ISSUES:
	WILL NOT RUN if the New NPCs.xlsx file is currently open
	I don't know how to make a not terrible GUI
